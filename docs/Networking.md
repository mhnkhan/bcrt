  Fixed problem with home network. Connected two PCs (Laptop and desktop).<br>
  Deleted a registry key (HLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSLicensing). Deleted all credentials in Windows Credentials Manager. Checked whether usual services are running and settings are correct. Now both PCs are ready for networking experiments.
